## Project exam 2

---

### Goal:

To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the  
finished product should reflect the candidateâ€™s general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

### Brief:

A newly launched accommodation booking site called Holidaze has approached you to develop a brand new front end for their application. While they have a list of required features, the design and user experience has not been specified. Working with the official API documentation, plan, design and build a modern front end accommodation booking application.

There are two aspects to this brief: the customer-facing side of the website where users can book holidays at a venue, and an admin-facing side of the website where users can register and manage venues and bookings at those venues.
